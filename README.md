# Advanced RAG App

**Advanced RAG App** is an interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help students query and obtain detailed, document-based answers. The app allows users to upload PDF documents, which are processed and indexed using FAISS and Sentence Transformers. Users then engage in a continuous chat with the system, which retrieves relevant document context and generates answers via the OpenRouter API. Optionally, users can include simulated web search results to enhance the answer.

## Architecture

Below is an overview of the architecture and data flow of our RAG system:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Uploads PDF| B[Document Processing]
    B --> C[Text Extraction<br/>(PyPDF2)]
    C --> D[Embedding Generation<br/>(Sentence Transformers)]
    D --> E[Indexing<br/>(FAISS)]
    A -->|Enters Query| F[Chat Interface<br/>(Streamlit)]
    F --> G[Context Retrieval<br/>(FAISS Search)]
    G --> H[Query Assembly]
    H --> I[LLM Query<br/>(OpenRouter API)]
    I --> J[Answer Generation]
    J --> F
```

### Key Components
- **Document Processing Module:**  
  Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
  
- **Embedding & Indexing Module:**  
  Generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and indexes document content with FAISS.
  
- **Query & Chat Module:**  
  A Streamlit-based chat interface that maintains a conversation (up to 10 messages) and retrieves context for each query.
  
- **LLM Query Module:**  
  Communicates with the OpenRouter API using a primary model (DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B) and a set of fallback models to generate detailed answers.
  
- **Optional Web Search Module:**  
  When enabled, simulated web search results are combined with the document context to provide enhanced answers and clickable source links.
  
- **User Feedback Module:**  
  Provides a sentiment rating slider for users to rate the answer quality.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for the interactive chat interface.

- **Backend / LLM:**  
  - [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai) (Primary: DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B; Fallbacks: deepseek-chat, deepseek-r1, nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct)

- **Document Processing:**  
  - [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for PDF text extraction.

- **Embedding Generation:**  
  - [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)

- **Vector Storage:**  
  - [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for efficient similarity search.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Streamlit Cloud or local deployment.

## Features

- **PDF Document Upload:**  
  Users can upload PDFs that are processed and indexed on the fly.

- **Interactive Chat Interface:**  
  Engage in continuous conversation with the system. The conversation history (up to 10 messages) is maintained during the session.

- **Document-Only & Web Search Modes:**  
  - By default, the assistant answers using document context only.  
  - Optionally, users can enable web search to combine simulated web results with document context.

- **Dynamic Context Retrieval:**  
  Relevant document snippets are retrieved using FAISS, ensuring precise answers based on uploaded content. If the document contains limited information, the system is prompted to elaborate using only the available details.

- **Model Fallback Mechanism:**  
  The app automatically switches between multiple models if one reaches its rate limitâ€”ensuring uninterrupted service.

- **Sentiment Rating:**  
  Users can rate the provided answer using a five-star scale.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a PDF:**  
   - Use the sidebar to upload a PDF file.
   - The document is processed, and its text is extracted and indexed.

2. **Ask a Question:**  
   - Enter your query in the chat interface.
   - Optionally, select "Include web search" to augment the answer with external sources.
   - The system retrieves relevant context from the document (and, if selected, simulated web search results).

3. **Receive an Answer:**  
   - The assistant generates a detailed, precise answer based on the context.
   - Related sources are provided as clickable links when web search is enabled.
   - Related images are displayed (simulated) if available.

4. **Continue the Conversation:**  
   - Conversation history is maintained (up to 10 messages) so you can ask follow-up questions without losing context.
